# The Smart Contract Burger Store

This project focuses on a case study which is developing an Ethereum smart contract to manage a burger store. This case study can be adopted for various cases to use smart contract for real-life businesses.

Basicaly the smart contract, which is developed in this project, provides:

- **The functions for customers:** Order burger, safe payment, get invoice and mark order as delivered functions.
- **The functions for burger store:** Get orders, send price, send invoice and safe payout functions.

This repository presents practices about:

- Setup a blockchain.
- Develop Ethereum smart contract.
- Deploy the contract and test it.

## Theory

Basically there are 3 components in this project which are:

Component | Explanation
--- | --- |
Burger Store | *Deploys the contract and owns it.*
Customers     | *Can order burgers to buy them.*
Smart Contract | *Provides safe and robust contract that are immutable.*

And here is given below a business flow chart which explains a sample flow for the usage of this smart contract.
